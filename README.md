How To Play:

Use WASD to move the player on the spawn platform for a better shot. Then, use the mouse cursor to aim and press space to blast off!
Aim for the green and white target blocks, and avoid purple anti-matter! In later levels, gravity fields will appear which will
change your player's trajectory.

To get an overhead view of the whole level, press and hold enter.

Good luck!
